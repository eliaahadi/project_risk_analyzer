Project Plan - Alpha Project

Project Goal: Develop a new mobile app.

Initial Scope: Develop core features A, B, and C.

Timeline: 6 months.

Budget: $100,000.

Meeting Notes (Week 2):

Discussed adding a new feature, D, which wasn't in the original plan. This will likely require additional resources and could potentially delay the project by 2 weeks. The cost increased by $10,000. There have been some technical difficulties with integrating the API. We are experiencing a staff shortage, which is impacting progress.
